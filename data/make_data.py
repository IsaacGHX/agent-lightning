### Necessary Skills and Tools

#### Skills
1. **Mathematical Calculation**: The ability to perform arithmetic operations such as multiplication, addition, and percentage calculations.
2. **Logical Reasoning**: The ability to break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it step by step.

#### Tools
1. **Generalist_Solution_Generator_Tool**: This tool can be used to perform the necessary calculations and logical reasoning to solve the problem.

### Explanation of Skills and Tools

#### Mathematical Calculation
- **Explanation**: The query requires calculating the revenue from different groups of ticket buyers. This involves multiplying the number of tickets sold by the respective discounted prices and then summing these amounts.
- **How it helps**: The skill of performing mathematical calculations is essential for determining the total revenue from each group of ticket buyers.

#### Logical Reasoning
- **Explanation**: The problem needs to be broken down into smaller parts to handle the different discount rates and the number of people in each group.
- **How it helps**: Logical reasoning helps in organizing the information and applying the correct discount rates to the appropriate number of people.

#### Generalist_Solution_Generator_Tool
- **Explanation**: This tool can be used to input the query and perform the necessary calculations and logical reasoning to determine the total revenue.
- **How it helps**: The tool simplifies the process by automating the calculations and ensuring accuracy. It can handle the step-by-step reasoning required to solve the problem.

### Additional Considerations
1. **Verification**: After using the tool, it is important to verify the calculations manually to ensure accuracy.
2. **Tool Limitations**: Be aware that the tool may provide hallucinated or incorrect responses, as mentioned in the metadata. Always cross-check the results.
3. **Complexity**: For more complex queries, breaking down the problem into smaller subtasks and using the tool multiple times may be necessary.

### ANSWER: [SILENT] ###

To solve the problem, we can use the Generalist_Solution_Generator_Tool to perform the necessary calculations. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:
